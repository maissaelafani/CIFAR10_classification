# Project Description
This project aims to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.  
The primary goal is to build and evaluate various machine learning models including traditional methods like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes as well as deep learning models 
like Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
